# Pacman Exercise

## Description
  In the project, I learned how to use a button to duplicate PacMan! Every time the button is pressed on the page, a PacMan is put into an array. The Pacman then randomly move around the page once the start button is pressed.  Each image keeps track of its movement. I used edge detection so that they wouldn’t continue off of the screen and once they hit the screen, the “turn around”. To make it appear that they are eating, I used a setTimeout function to have the image change on a loop. 

## How to Run
  To add this to your machine, simply clone the repository. Make sure that you have all the files-images included. If you just want to check out how the program looks in your browser, click this link: https://jorubelle.github.io/pacman/

## Roadmap to Future Improvements
  I would like to fix the bug of the changing speeds when the start game button is pressed multiple times. I want to have one PacMan move in a more graph like motion. I also want to have the PacMan not cover the buttons when they are created.
